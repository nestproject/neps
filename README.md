# Nest Enhancement Proposals

Nest Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) are a formal way of proposing changes
to the Nest specification.

## When you need to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial" changes to
the Nest specification.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Nest team.

The "NEP" process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path
for new features and changes in the Nest specification.

## What the process is

In short, to get a major feature added to Nest one must first get a NEP
relevant to that feature merged and accepted into the NEP repository as a
markdown file. At that point the NEP is 'active' and may be implemented with
the goal of eventual inclusion into NEP.

Please see [RFC 1](final/0001-nep-process.md) for more details.

The NEP process is inspired by, and very similar to
[PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), [DEP](https://github.com/django/deps)
and the [Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
